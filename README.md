Goddamn I love getting nerdsnipped

There's this game [graphwar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1899700/Graphwar/). I've had the amazing honour of being nerdsnipped by a friend into beating this game. You have agents on a screen and must write a function which your projectile will follow to kill your opponents agents. Clearly this game is at horrible risk of being completely beated by anyone who can fit a polynomial. I did this in real time while playing with friends in google sheets, this is a slow underoptimized method, so throw python and a late night at the problem.
